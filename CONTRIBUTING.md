# Contributing

Welcome to our contributing guide. In this guide, you will find everything you need
to get up and running as a contributor to conda.org. This is a contributing guide
for individuals contributing content and for those who wish to contribute code.
A more detailed breakdown of these two personas is shown below:

- **Content contributors**
    - These individuals wishing to help contribute content for the actual website
      which can include news and blog posts
- **Technical contributors**
    - These are individuals who want to contribute to the actual code of the website
      or somehow modify the way it looks by using HTML, CSS or Javascript.

In this guide, we will start off by explaining contribution steps that apply
to both personas and then branch off to explain specifics for each.

### Prerequisites

To follow this guide, you will need to have these programs installed on your computer:

- git: [installation link][installing-git]
- npm: [installation link][installing-npm]

It is also highly encouraged that you at least have a basic understanding of how to use
git at the command line. If you do not, please read check out the book [Pro Git][pro-git]

the [Fork a repo][github-forking-how-to] guide from GitHub first.

After you have done that, you are ready to clone this repository to your local computer
where you can begin making edits. The commands for doing so will be different depending
on your user name, but a typical example is shown below:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:username/conda-dot-org.git
```

Once you have cloned this repository, you now need to create a branch that will hold the
work you are planning to contribute. You can do that with the following command:

```
$ git checkout -b my-new-contribution
```

At this point, you are ready to start editing files. Once
