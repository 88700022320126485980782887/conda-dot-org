# What is conda?

[Conda](https://docs.conda.io/) is an [open-source](https://github.com/conda/conda#readme) package manager and environment management system that helps users install, run, and update over 7,500+ open-source packages as well as their dependencies. It also creates, saves, loads and switches between environments on your local computer.

Conda was created primarily for Python programs, but it’s language-agnostic, which means that it can package and distribute software written in any language. It runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS, as well as various platforms and architectures.

The term "conda" might also be seen in several related contexts:

* Anaconda®️ is a Python/R data science distribution that contains conda. Anaconda®️ costs nothing to install and use, [ships with 250 packages](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/packages/pkg-docs/), and offers free community support.
* Miniconda is a small, bootstrap version of Anaconda®️ that includes only conda, Python, the packages that they depend on, and a small number of other popular and useful packages. Users of Miniconda can run the `conda install` command to install 720+ additional conda packages from the Anaconda®️ repository.
