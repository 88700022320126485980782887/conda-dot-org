        <a href="https://docs.conda.io/" target="_blank">Conda</a> is an <a href="https://github.com/conda/conda#readme" target="_blank">open-source</a> package manager and environment management system that helps users install, run, and
        update over 7,500+ open-source packages as well as their dependencies. It also creates,
        saves, loads and switches between environments on your local computer.
        <br></br><br></br>
        Conda was created primarily for Python programs, but itâ€™s language-agnostic, which means
        that it can package and distribute software written in any language. It runs on Windows,
        Linux, and macOS, as well as various platforms and architectures.
