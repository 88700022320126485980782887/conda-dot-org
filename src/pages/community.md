# Conda community

The 'conda' community is made of its millions of users, the packaging maintainers and, last but not least, the tool developers.
It's not a single organization, but a consorted effort of its many components, all devoted to the mission of providing easy to access to all kinds of free software no matter the operating system or language.

We firmly believe that everyone belongs in open-source and we want to start by thanking you for taking the time to read this page.


## The many meanings of 'conda'

Traditionally associated with the Anaconda distribution, nowadays the term ‘conda’ refers to more than just a package manager or a software repository. Its many definitions also encompass community packaging efforts like conda-forge or bioconda, as well as new tools developed in the Mamba and conda-incubator organizations, and prove that the conda ecosystem is no longer defined by a single actor.

Organizations include:
- @conda, plus Anaconda, Inc. efforsts like @AnacondaRecipes, @anaconda-distribution, @ContinuumIO
- @conda-forge, @regro
- @conda-incubator & conda-tools
- @mamba-org 
- @bioconda

Some tools you might be familiar with are `conda` or `conda-build` themselves, but also community efforts like `mamba`, `boa`, `setup-miniconda`, `conda-lock` or `conda-tree`, among many more!
